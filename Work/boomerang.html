          We were five Hyper Island students during this five week project in October-November 2016, analyzing Boomerang's digital presence.
        </br></br>
        During the project we analyzed the different data collecting tools and social media channels Boomerang are using. With the gained insights we created an analytical data business report including conclusions and suggestions on how Boomerang can improve their customer experience and digital presence.
