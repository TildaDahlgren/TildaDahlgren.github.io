        <h1>WHAT</h1>
        <p>
          I worked with this product for three weeks at Hyper Island, in a group of six people. While trying to figure out what to build, we did some research of what people like at the moment. Kittens and Beer. Then we decided; we will create a drinking game from scratch, involving kittens and alcohol.
        </br></br>
          During the project we were supposed to work in an agile environment using a SCRUM board.

      <div class = "how">
        <h1>HOW</h1>
        <p>
          I had the responsibility of the design, where I was working in Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop. I was also working with the content of the page, creating some of the different drinking games and finding material.
        </br></br>
          By working in an agile environment and using the SCRUM board we were always working aligned with each other.
