          Sthål is bohemian style ceramics of Swedish design. Susanna Theander and Helena Åkesson-Liedberg. Two Swedish creative souls with a background in illustration, styling, design and cookbook creation, united in a love for great food, good friends and finding beauty slightly beside the mainstream.

        <h1>WHAT</h1>
        <p>
          During four months me and Josefina Liedberg created a website for Sthål beside our other jobs and projects. Our task was to create the copy, design and front end development.
        </br></br>
          The website was supposed to be a place where retailers, buyers and media can find collections, new collections and to get inspired by Sthål's ceramics.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class = "how">
        <h1>HOW</h1>
        <p>
          Me and Josefina met a couple of days a week after work hours to work on the website together. We worked most of the time apart but had regular Skype-meetings to update our progress, also using Trello for structure.
        </br></br>
          During the project we were working with tools as; Trello, Google Analytics, Photoshop, MailChimp and Atom.
